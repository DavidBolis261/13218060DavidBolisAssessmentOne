Dear Marker, 
 Thank You for your time.
 I just wanted to note the following
 1) The Level Generator did not work properly, So I added the code as much as I can, however to construct the actual level I used a visual asset from the internet of PacMan's Map. I did however create all the walls and I presented them in the game just so you can see that I did create it.
 2) I Created all the Audio Assets and Visual Assets myself.
 3) When Launching the game, PacMan should move clockwise, I have highlited the code which makes pacman collide with the pallets, I have also placed code which will make PacMan react to input, in an uncalled function, please do not mark that. 
 4) There are four ghosts in the came, every three seconds they will transition Normal State > Scared State > Dead> Recovering 
 Thank You
